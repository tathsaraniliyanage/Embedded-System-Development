Embedded system development with Arduino


Introduction to embedded systems and Arduino

what is an embedded system ?
overview of Arduino platform: hardware and software
difference between microcontrollers and microprocessors
real-world applications of Arduino-based embedded systems


---features---

* It has dedicated functionalities
* It has real time operation
* low limit of resource usage
* high relayability
* low power convension


---overview of Arduino platform: hardware and software---

Arduino is a most popular platform
download software and get hardware component.
write code in software and upload it to hardware component
Arduino is a micro control
Arduino is a component which can create electronic prototype projects.
arduinouno : arduino uno has a chip

usages of arduino :
home automation system  - 
 manually workingg lights,fans use arduino and set the push switch to an arduino and make it so that
 you can switch on and off from the same place.


usage of cable :
code upload to hardware
sms reading


--used languages
 c ,c++


----microcontrollers vs microprocessors----

raspberry pi - 
It can create large scale projects(It can coding python according to capacities)

usages :
Can be used as typing large scale bus root 
It is used to show time in buses.
using for cameras
can insert sim
dual display, 2k output
You can remove the cpu and use it as a computer




software contribution:


// C++ code
//
void setup()
{
//pin number , pin eken ena data ek in krnwd out krnwd kiyna ek
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
//13 pin ekt valtage ekk denn// nwthila inn//off krnn //thathpryak delay wel inn
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}
  
  

  
  
Brief explanation :

 * The things that need to happen only once are included in the void setup method.
       void setup(){}

  * Iterating is done in the loop method
       void loop(){}

  * pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(pin number , whether the data coming from the pin is input or output)
